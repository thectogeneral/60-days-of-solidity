Objective: Learn how mappings work in Solidity for key-value storage.

Concept:

    •	Mappings are key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value.
    •	They are used for efficient lookups and do not store the keys.
    •	The key-value relationships can only be modified through functions within the contract.

Deliverable:

    •	Write a contract that uses mappings to store balances and has functions to update, retrieve, and delete balances.
