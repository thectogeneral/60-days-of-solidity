contracts, state variables, and functions:

    •	Contracts: Fundamental building blocks for Ethereum applications, like classes in object-oriented programming.
    •	State Variables: Stored permanently on the blockchain.
    •	Functions: Methods that modify or return values.

Deliverable: Deploy the contract in Remix and share the contract address.
