1. Blockchain Basics

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in such a way that the records cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. This is secured through cryptography and often uses mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to reach a consensus.

    •	Proof of Work (PoW): Used by Bitcoin, PoW requires participants (miners) to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. It’s energy-intensive but secure.
    •	Consensus: The process through which the network agrees on the state of the blockchain. Common methods include PoW and PoS.
    •	Decentralized Ledger: Instead of having a central authority like a bank, blockchain networks spread the authority across many participants, making it harder to corrupt or manipulate.

2. Ethereum vs. Bitcoin

    • Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, focused on peer-to-peer transactions and secure value transfer.
    • Ethereum, while also a blockchain, allows for more than just transferring value. It introduces the concept of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

Ethereum also uses its own currency called Ether (ETH), but the key difference is its ability to handle more complex, programmable logic using smart contracts.

3. Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a piece of code that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts automatically execute and enforce agreements once specific conditions are met. They are written in languages like Solidity.

How they work:

    •	A smart contract is deployed on the blockchain and given an address.
    •	Users can interact with it through transactions, triggering predefined actions based on the contract’s logic.
    •	Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed or tampered with.

Deliverable: Short summary of how blockchain and smart contracts work:

Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable ledger that stores transactions across many computers. Ethereum expands on this by allowing smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the logic encoded directly into the blockchain. These contracts automatically execute once conditions are met, providing trustless agreements without intermediaries.
