**Objective**: Learn about Solidity data types.

Solidity supports several data types, including:

    •	uint: Unsigned integer (non-negative).
    •	int: Signed integer (can be negative).
    •	address: Represents an Ethereum address.
    •	string: Text data.
    •	bool: Boolean true/false.

**Deliverable**: Write a contract with different state variables and a function that returns their values.
