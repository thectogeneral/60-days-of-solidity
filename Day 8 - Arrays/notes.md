Objective: Learn about static and dynamic arrays in Solidity.

Concept:

    •	Arrays in Solidity can be either fixed-size (static) or dynamic.
    •	Arrays store elements of the same type and are indexed starting from 0.
    •	Solidity supports push(), pop(), and length properties for dynamic arrays.
    •	You can access, modify, and delete elements from an array by index.

Deliverable:

    •	Write a contract that stores a list of addresses in an array and has functions to add/remove addresses.
