Objective: Combine arrays, mappings, and structs to build more complex contracts.

Concept:

    •	Combining arrays, mappings, and structs allows you to create more intricate smart contracts.
    •	For example, managing a list of user profiles stored in mappings, with functions to update their data.

Deliverable:

    •	Write a contract that stores user profiles (struct) in a mapping, and allows retrieval and updates.
