**Objective**: Understand functions, function modifiers, and visibility in Solidity.

Solidity functions can have different levels of visibility:

    •	public: Accessible by anyone.
    •	private: Only accessible within the contract.
    •	internal: Can only be called within the contract or derived contracts.
    •	external: Only called externally (i.e., from a different contract).

**Deliverable**: Deploy a contract with at least 4 functions, each demonstrating a different visibility modifier.
