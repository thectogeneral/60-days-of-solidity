Objective: Learn about custom data structures using structs.

Concept:

    •	Structs allow you to group related data together in a single type.
    •	You can define and initialize structs within contracts to organize data efficiently.

Deliverable:

    •	Write a contract that defines a User struct (name, age, address) and allows users to create/update profiles.
